at the end of the measure if you keep hitting it will update the last note. 

will note update notes until loop is completed. ( i think )


FUTURE: will need to break it down to listen for 10 cent 2.5 in order to determine faster what is being hit. also will need to buy a better sensor to snese the notes being hit.

time will continue to go on but it wont resolve ths case statement fast enough.
